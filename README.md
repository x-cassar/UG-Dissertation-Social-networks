#Abstract
"This study evaluates how social networks influence Kenyan smallholder dairy farmers’ decision to adopt three dairy technologies, namely improved breed cattle, improved forage varieties, and vaccination. Dairy farming generates 4% of Kenyan GDP and contributes extensively to the income and food security of 1.8 million smallholders in the country, yet low uptake of these technologies means that dairy productivity is low. This continues to constrain dairy development in the country, impeding nutritional and economic gains, and perpetuates the high greenhouse-gas intensity of Kenyan dairy systems. 
Snowball sampling was used to collect survey data from 258 smallholders in four sites in West Kenya regarding demographic and household characteristics, dairy farming practices, and other external factors, as well as information about the members of farmers’ social networks. Using this data, a series of logistic regression models were constructed to identify the influence of the adoption decisions of farmers’ network members (endogenous effects) and the characteristics of these network members (exogenous effects) on the likelihood of technology adoption.
Farmers’ probability of adopting dairy technologies was found to increase significantly with the number of adopters in their network. This constitutes clear evidence of endogenous effects, i.e. the behaviour of social network members influencing farmers’ adoption decisions. The characteristics of farmers’ network members (e.g., their age, educational attainment), however, did not have a significant influence. 
This study contributes to the literature on how social networks shape the adoption of technologies amongst farmers in developing countries, being the first to quantify social network effects in dairy systems and agricultural systems in Kenya. Findings are also of policy relevance as they indicate that social networks could be harnessed for low-cost agricultural extension and that interventions which facilitate interaction between farmers may spur the dissemination of agricultural technologies through the formation of new network connections. Future research should focus on how to capitalise on these social network effects, and the evaluation of interventions’ impact on the social network formation.
This work also provides insights relevant to current dairy extension systems in West Kenya, proposing context- and technology-specific recommendations towards dairy development in the area."
